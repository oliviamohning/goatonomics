# GOATONOMICS 2025: A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF IMAGINARY GOATS

Welcome to the most unnecessary but heartfelt data project you’ll ever see, guaranteed.

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard and dataset chronicling the social, emotional, and dietary lives of 99 "fictional" goats. Each goat has hopes, dreams, and a complex social life as a beloved member of their society.

## The Premise
Tired of wrangling messy, real-world datasets and looking for insights that held great significance to my many constituents, I asked myself: “What if I treated a herd of imaginary goats with the same analytical rigor as a Fortune 500 company spearheaded by Nancy Pelosi?”

And Goatonomics was born - a serious visual exploration of goat mood swings, friendship networks, favorite colors, musical preferences, gang affiliation, and the little things that most people don't notice. "That's because," my local farmers may printf in protest, "they do not exist." To this I inquire: have you even looked? Or were you looking at your phone while your herd of goats was coralled and harassed by your herding dog robot?  
Some goats listen to *Bohemian Rhapsody.* Others scream into the void, like you and me. Correlation may not equal causation, but it’s all very suspicious and I'm going to get to the bottom of it. My job search fatigue has set in and this is my way of venting some of my angst.

## The Data
Columns include, but are not limited to:
- **Name:** Maggie, Hank, Clover...etc.
- **Gender:** Male, Female, Nonbinary, Existential Crisis  
- **Mood:** Mostly grumpy, chill, or rowdy, with some fun surprises
- **Favorite Color:** Heavy bias toward green, because grass  
- **Herd Affiliation:** Chill Grazers, Goat Mafia, Anarchist Climbers, etc.  
- **Bleat Volume (dB):** A numeric measurement of the goat's confidence, moral outrage, spiritual distress  
- **BFF, nemesis, crush_on:** Self-explanatory. Goats are social creatures.  

The dataset was *meticulously* handcrafted in Mockaroo until I accidentally swiped on my MacBook trackpad and triggered the browser's "back" button to lose my data. I almost cried but then I just did it myself in Google Sheets with some help from ChatGPT. And the LOWER() function because ChatGPT loves making everything Title Case. Then I switched to Microsoft Excel and we were off to the races.

## The Analysis
Using Microsoft Excel and Power BI, I sought answers to department-critical questions:
- What is the emotional state of each goat gang? Which goat gang affiliation is associated with the most happiness?
- Are hungry goats louder than chill goats?
- Do goats with softer coats have more friends? In other words, are goats bigoted? Remember, it's important to assign your own conclusions to your findings, even if they otherwise don't correlate. What, you want objectivity? No you don't, nerd.
- Is there a measurable relationship between favorite color and moral decay?
- What song do calm goats appreciate the most?

Each visualization will probably be made with genuine care and respect for conventional research ethics.

## Planned Visualizations
- **Mood Distribution Pie Chart:** The circle of emotional (in)stability  
- **Horn Length vs. Diet:** Joe Rogan will clutch his pearls when he sees this  
- **Goat Happiness Index Gauge:** Important for influencing goat policy  
- **Perhaps others:** Depends on how busy/bored I am, but stay tuned!  

Bonus slicer: *Filter by Relationship Status.* Every goat deserves love, because unlike humans, goats do not commit genocide or litter tiny liquor bottles on the streets.

## Tools Used
- Mockaroo, then ChatGPT
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI (for questionable insights)
- An overactive imagination, post-travel illness, boredom, and an appreciation for all creatures great and small - especially farm animals with pupils that can only be described as rectangular

## Key Findings

Using Excel PivotTables, descriptive analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between mood and herd affiliation among 99 goats. The results highlight distinct behavioral and emotional patterns within each group.

### 1. Goat Mood Distribution by Gang Affiliation

This visualization compares the frequency of emotional states across the four herds: **Anarchist Climbers**, **Chill Grazers**, **Goat Mafia**, and **Nomadic Yogis**.

</p>
**Insights**
- **Chill Grazers** and **Anarchist Climbers** have the highest proportions of *chill* and *hungry* goats, suggesting greater emotional stability.  
- **Goat Mafia** members show the largest share of *enlightened* goats, indicating introspection or heightened self-awareness within the group.  
- **Nomadic Yogis** demonstrate relatively balanced emotional representation, with fewer extreme states.

### 2. Average Happiness Index by Gang Affiliation

A calculated **Happiness Index** (derived via VLOOKUP and a reference table) was averaged across herds to measure relative well-being.

</p>
**Insights**
- **Anarchist Climbers** achieved the highest average happiness, suggesting a positive correlation between autonomy and well-being.  
- **Chill Grazers** and **Nomadic Yogis** show moderate, stable satisfaction levels.  
- **Goat Mafia** exhibit the lowest happiness despite high enlightenment scores, indicating that awareness may inversely affect subjective well-being.

### Interpretation

Across the dataset, there appears to be an inverse relationship between enlightenment and happiness. Goats associated with introspective or disciplined groups (such as the Goat Mafia) report lower happiness levels, while those aligned with more autonomous or chaotic herds (such as the Anarchist Climbers) report higher well-being.  

These patterns, though fictional, mirror dynamics often observed in organizational behavior—suggesting that autonomy and community structure can influence satisfaction even in simulated goat societies.

## Future Work
- More analytics. I really hope to find that at least one goat has a crush on itself. I might just fudge my data to make it so. This is illegal in real data analytics, but is still probably done in secret. Who said that?
- Actually make the PowerBI dashboard. I'm so looking forward to this. For now, I need to sleep the sickness away.
- Add DAX measure for Goat Happiness Index 2.0
- Integrate weather data in a new table to predict bleat frequency vs weather and show I can do JOINs in SQL or something
- Maybe create a machine learning model to detect impending barnyard drama, but I don't know how I'd measure the drama. Another table will need to be created, or we will scrap this idea and speak no more of it.
- Replace all visuals with goat emojis once I'm employed
- Reincarnate as a wild goat after I die of natural causes, surrounded by my loving family

## A Note to Recruiters
This project proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am a master of Excel, PowerBI and data modeling. I consider this project my magnum opus until further notice. Data scientists may or may not find this funny. You may or may not find this funny. If you do, we should work together. No goats were harmed in the creation of this dataset.
