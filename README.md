# 🐐 GOATONOMICS 2025: A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF IMAGINARY GOATS

Welcome to the most unnecessary but heartfelt data project you’ll ever see, guaranteed.

This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** and **dataset** chronicling the social, emotional, and dietary lives of *99 "fictional" goats*. Each goat has hopes, dreams, and at least one existential crisis. Some are enlightened. Most are calm. Some are hungry. All are beloved members of their society.

## The Premise
Tired of wrangling messy, real-world datasets and looking for insights that held great significance to my many constituents, I asked myself:
> “What if I treated a herd of imaginary goats with the same analytical rigor as a Fortune 500 company spearheaded by Nancy Pelosi?”

And Goatonomics was born - a serious visual exploration of goat mood swings, friendship networks, favorite colors, musical preferences, gang affiliation, and the little things that most people don't notice. "That's because," my local farmers may printf in protest, "they do not exist." To this I inquire: have you even looked? Or were you looking at your phone while your herd of goats were coralled and harassed by your herding dog robot?  
Some goats listen to *Bohemian Rhapsody.* Others scream into the void, like you and me. Correlation may not equal causation, but it’s all very suspicious and I'm going to get to the bottom of it. Hand me my shovel, my job search fatigue has struck and this is my way of venting some of my rage at seeing yet another third-party company post an expired job ad on LinkedIn.

## The Data
Columns include, but are not limited to:
- **Name:** (Maggie, Hank, Clover...)
- **Gender:** Male, Female, Nonbinary, Existential Crisis  
- **Mood:** Mostly *grumpy, chill,* or *rowdy* — with some fun surprises
- **Favorite Color:** Heavy bias toward *green*, because grass  
- **Herd Affiliation:** *Chill Grazers*, *Goat Mafia*, *Anarchist Climbers*, etc.  
- **Bleat Volume (dB):** A numeric measurement of the goat's confidence, or spiritual distress  
- **BFF, nemesis, crush_on:** Self-explanatory. Goats are social creatures.  

The dataset was handcrafted in Mockaroo until I accidentally swiped on my MacBook trackpad and triggered the browser's "back" button to lose my data. I almost cried but then I just did it myself in Google Sheets with the help of ChatGPT.  
Statistically meaningless, emotionally significant.

## The Analysis
Using **Power BI**, I sought answers to department-critical questions:
- Are hangry goats louder than *chill* goats?
- Do goats with softer coats have more friends? In other words, are goats bigoted? Remember, it's important to assign your own conclusions to your findings, even if they otherwise don't correlate. What, you want objectivity? No you don't, nerd.
- Is there a measurable relationship between favorite color and moral decay?
- What song do chaotic goats appreciate the most?

Each visualization was made with genuine care and respect for conventional research ethics.

## Planned Visualizations
- **Mood Distribution Pie Chart:** The circle of emotional (in)stability  
- **Horn Length vs. Diet:** Joe Rogan will clutch his pearls when he sees this  
- **Goat Happiness Index Gauge:** Important for influencing goat policy  
- **Perhaps others:** Depends on how busy/bored I am, but stay tuned!  

Bonus slicer: *Filter by Relationship Status.* Every goat deserves love, because unlike humans, goats do not commit genocide or litter tiny liquor bottles on the streets.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (for questionable insights)
- Mockaroo, then ChatGPT
- Google Sheets
- An overactive imagination, post-travel illness, boredom, and an appreciation for all creatures great and small - especially farm animals with pupils that can only be described as rectangular

## Key Findings
1. Coming soon. I really hope to find that at least one goat has a crush on itself. I might just fudge my data to make it so. This is illegal in real data analytics, but is still probably done in secret. Who said that?

---

## Future Work
- Actually make the PowerBI dashboard. I'm so looking forward to this. For now, I need to sleep the sickness away.
- Add DAX measure for **Goat Happiness Index 2.0 (Now With More Angst)**  
- Integrate weather data in a new table to predict bleat frequency vs weather and show I can do JOINs in SQL or something  
- Maybe create a machine learning model to detect impending barnyard drama, but I don't know how I'd measure the drama. Another table will need to be created, or we will scrap this idea and speak no more of it.  
- Replace all visuals with goat emojis once I'm employed
- Reincarnate as a wild goat after I die of natural causes, surrounded by my loving family

## A Note to Recruiters
Data scientists may or may not find this funny. You may or may not find this funny. I find it fun, and if you do too, then perhaps we should work together?  
This project proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am a master of PowerBI and data modeling.  
I consider this project my magnum opus until further notice.
No goats were harmed in the creation of this dataset.
